LORDS MOBILE WOW TROOP COMP
This app is designed specifically for inexperienced / experienced Lords Mobile gamers who lead rallies in World of Wonder, Baron, etc. Using our easy-to-use input functions, you can register and save data on enemy compositions and the troop compositions and formations that you used to counter them.
